# Factory Pattern

The Factory design is a pretty straigtforward design pattern where you create a factory object that returns several objecs that implement a specefic interface.

In our example the ShoeFactory returns a shoe depending on the paramater.

The benefit of this pattern is that we are able to build objects without revealing the creation logic.
