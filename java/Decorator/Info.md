# Decorator Pattern

In the Decorator pattern, the user is able to extend the functionality of an existing object with a wrapper class. In the example the base class to work off of is the Model object and the Hypebeast class wraps the model. The decorator class constructor takes in the object it will wrap as a parameter.
